# DivExp.py
This Python program demonstrates how to perform division with error handling using assertions and custom exception handling. It ensures that the input values are valid and handles errors like division by zero.

Features
- Asserts that the numerator is greater than 0.
- Raises a `ZeroDivisionError` if the denominator is zero.
- Takes user input for the numerator and denominator and calculates the division result.

# cel-to-fah.py
This simple Python script converts a temperature value from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

Description

This program takes a temperature in Celsius and converts it to Fahrenheit using the formula:

                          𝐹=𝐶×1.8+32
Where:
- 𝐶 is the temperature in Celsius
- 𝐹 is the temperature in Fahrenheit
  
For example, if you input 37.5°C, the program will output 99.5°F.

# factorial.py
This Python program calculates the binomial coefficient.

The program allows users to input the values for n and r, and then calculates and outputs the corresponding binomial coefficient.

Features
* Calculates the binomial coefficient 𝐶(𝑛,𝑟) using the factorial formula.
* User-friendly input prompts to enter values for n and r.
* Outputs the result rounded to three decimal places.

# fibonacci.py
This Python program generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-defined number of terms.

Description

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1. The sequence looks like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...

This script prompts the user to input the number of terms they want to generate, then calculates and displays the Fibonacci sequence up to that number.

Features
- Prompts the user to input the number of terms.
- Handles invalid input (e.g., negative or zero terms).
- Displays the Fibonacci sequence up to the specified number of terms.

# number
This Python program checks whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero. The program prompts the user to input a number, and based on the input, it prints an appropriate message.

Features
- Prompts the user to input a number.
- Checks if the number is positive, negative, or zero.
- Outputs a message corresponding to the input number's sign.

# number_sum
This Python program calculates the sum of natural numbers from 1 to a user-provided number. It takes an input from the user, checks if it's a positive integer, and then computes the sum using a while loop.

Features
- Prompts the user to input a number.
- Validates if the input is a positive integer.
- Calculates the sum of all natural numbers up to the input number using a while loop.
- Displays the result of the sum.
