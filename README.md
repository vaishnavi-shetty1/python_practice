# DivExp.py
This Python program demonstrates how to perform division with error handling using assertions and custom exception handling. It ensures that the input values are valid and handles errors like division by zero.

Features
- Asserts that the numerator is greater than 0.
- Raises a `ZeroDivisionError` if the denominator is zero.
- Takes user input for the numerator and denominator and calculates the division result.

# factorial.py
This Python program calculates the binomial coefficient.

The program allows users to input the values for n and r, and then calculates and outputs the corresponding binomial coefficient.

Features
* Calculates the binomial coefficient 𝐶(𝑛,𝑟) using the factorial formula.
* User-friendly input prompts to enter values for n and r.
* Outputs the result rounded to three decimal places.
